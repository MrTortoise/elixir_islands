# elixir_islands

I wrote some code without being paid to do so!!!
Its basically definatley not battleships


admittedly its going through a book as really looking to get into phoenix live view and channels.

Forgot how much i like doctests in elixir.
[Eg like here](islands_engine/lib/islands_engine/board.ex)

if whoerver reads this installs elixir you can run the tests with
```bash
mix test
```
